# Kidney Disease Prediction

This project focuses on predicting kidney disease using a comprehensive dataset. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the implementation of various machine learning models to accurately identify the presence of kidney disease. Key steps include:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation

## Files
- `Final_pre_processing_data.csv`: Preprocessed dataset used for model training.
- `kidney_disease.csv`: Original dataset containing raw kidney disease data.
- `main.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with the complete analysis and model implementation.

## Usage
Clone the repository and run the Jupyter notebook to explore the data analysis and model training process. Ensure you have the required libraries installed.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
